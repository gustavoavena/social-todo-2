This is an assignment for CPSC 113 - Programming and Entrepreneurship.

The staff gave us a small starting code, and we were supposed to develop this social todo app that passes all the tests in the test script (developed using casperjs).

We had around around one week to do this.

The app is deployed on heroku and can be tested here:

The testing script used to test and grade this app can be found here:
